# Modeling-expected-goals-from-football-data-with-Python

An `Expected goals (xG)` model is built using data from a recently concluded season of the English Premier League. It is a statistical model that fits to data, can be used to predict the outcome of events and lays ground for later, more advanced ML models.

`What is xG?`
It is a statistical measure of chance quality. For example, it is the probability that on a given day a shot taken from a particular location on the pitch would result in a goal scored. Its numerous uses range from **conveying the full story** of a match that tells more than just the scoreline, **predicting future goals scored** (great for bookmaking and betting companies) and **guide players and coaches in decision making**.
